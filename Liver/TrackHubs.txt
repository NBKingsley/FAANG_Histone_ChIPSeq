#To create custom tracks on UCSC's genome browser for EquCab2, use the following address: http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgCustom
#Copy and paste the appropriate track lines below into the URL entry space on the add custom tracks webpage. This should create a track and provide it with an informative name for easier viewing. 

#To add the regular bed files use the following track line:

track name="H3K4me1_Liver" description="H3K4me1_Liver_Combined_Peaks" DataUrl=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NBKingsley/FAANG_Histone_ChIPSeq/master/Liver/H3K4me1_Liver_Combined_Peaks.bed

track name="H3K4me3_Liver" description="H3K4me3_Liver_Combined_Peaks" DataUrl=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NBKingsley/FAANG_Histone_ChIPSeq/master/Liver/H3K4me3_Liver_Combined_Peaks.bed

track name="H3K27ac_Liver" description="H3K27ac_Liver_Combined_Peaks" DataUrl=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NBKingsley/FAANG_Histone_ChIPSeq/master/Liver/H3K27ac_Liver_Combined_Peaks.bed

# To add the bigBed files (very similar but have some extra attributes for easier viewing) use the following track line:

track type=bigBed name="H3K4me1_Liver" description="H3K4me1_Liver_Combined_Peaks" bigDataUrl=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NBKingsley/FAANG_Histone_ChIPSeq/master/Liver/H3K4me1_Liver_Combined_Peaks.bb
